## Objectives
* To explore gun death data curated by FiveThirtyEight [original data available here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data) by
    * Month
    * Intent
    * Age and sex
    * Education
    * Season
    * Intent by race
    * Police-relatedness 

## Read in the data

The gun_deaths.csv is provided in the repository. 
```{r load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)    # load tidyverse packages, including ggplot2
library(knitr)
library(readr)

# read in the data
gun_deaths <- read_csv("gun_deaths.csv")

```

## Generating a data frame that summarizes the number of gun deaths per month and printing using `kable()`. 

Knitr is part of the knitr package. Allows you to change column names and add captions and make pretty tables in your knitted document. Hint: set the argument format = "markdown"


```{r month, warning=FALSE}
gun_deaths_monthly <- gun_deaths %>%
    transmute(month = factor(month.abb[month], levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))) %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    count()

kable(
    gun_deaths_monthly,
    format = "markdown",
    col.names = c("Month", "Total deaths")
)

```


### Generating a bar chart with human-readable labels on the x-axis. That is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`.

```{r month_chart}
ggplot(gun_deaths_monthly, aes(x = month, y = n)) +
    geom_col(
        fill = "grey50"
    ) +
    
    labs(
        title = "Gun deaths by month in 2012-2014",
        x = "Month",
        y = "Total deaths"
    ) + 
    
    theme_bw()

```

## Generating a bar chart that identifies the number of gun deaths associated with each type of intent cause of death. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest values.

```{r intent}
gun_deaths %>%
    filter(intent != "Not Available") %>%
    group_by(intent) %>%
    count() %>%

    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(intent, -n), y = n)) +
    geom_col(fill = "grey50") +
    
    labs(
        x = "Intent",
        y = "Total deaths",
        title = "Gun deaths by intent in 2012-2014"
    ) +
    
    theme_bw()

```

## Generating a boxplot visualizing the age of gun death victims, by sex. Print the average age of female gun death victims.

```{r age_&_sex}
gun_deaths_sex_age <- gun_deaths %>%
    filter(age != "Not Available" & sex != "Not Available") %>%
    transmute(sex, age = as.numeric(age)) %>%
    group_by(sex)

    ggplot(gun_deaths_sex_age, aes(x = sex, y = age)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
        
    labs(
        x = "Sex",
        y = "Age",
        title = "Age of gun victims by sex in 2012-2014"
    ) +
    
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Female", "Male")) +   
    
    theme_bw()

kable(
    format = "markdown",
    gun_deaths_sex_age %>%
        filter(sex == "F") %>%
        summarize(mean(age)),
    col.names = c("Sex", "Average age")
)
  

```


## How many white males with at least a high school education were killed by guns in 2012?

```{r education}
kable(
    format = "markdown",
    gun_deaths %>%
        filter(education != "Less than HS", year == 2012, race == "White", sex == "M") %>%
        count(),
    col.names = ("Number of white males with high school or higher killed by guns in 2012")
)
```


## Which season of the year has the most gun deaths?

Assume that:

* Winter = January-March
* Spring = April-June
* Summer = July-September
* Fall = October-December

```{r season}
deaths_by_season <- gun_deaths %>%
    mutate(season = 
                ifelse(month == 1 | month == 2 | month == 3, "Winter",
                ifelse(month == 4 | month == 5 | month == 6, "Spring",
                ifelse(month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9, "Summer",
                ifelse(month == 10 | month == 11 | month == 12, "Fall", NA))))) %>%
    group_by(season) %>%
    count() %>%
    arrange(desc(n))

kable(
    format = "markdown",
    deaths_by_season,
    col.names = c("Season", "Number of deaths")
)

```


# These are more open ended questions from here on out, you could look at making multiple summaries or types of plots. 

### Are whites who are killed by guns more likely to die because of suicide or homicide? How does this compare to blacks and hispanics?

** 

```{r race}
deaths_by_race <- gun_deaths %>%
    select(race, intent) %>%
    filter(intent %in% c("Homicide", "Suicide"),
           race %in% c("White", "Hispanic", "Black")) %>%
    group_by(race, intent) %>%
    count()

kable(
    format = "markdown",
    deaths_by_race,
    col.names = c("Race", "Intent", "Number of deaths")
)

```

(hint maybe looking at percentages would be good)
```{r race_2}

x <- deaths_by_race %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  mutate(homicide_percent = 100*n / sum(n))
  
  x
    
```


### Are police-involved gun deaths significantly different from other gun deaths? Assess the relationship between police involvement and age, police involvement and race, and the intersection of all three variables.

```{r police}

```

Think about performing stats such as a t.test to see if differences you are plotting are statistically significant

```{r stats?}


```


```{r police_2}

```

```{r stats_2?}


```


Finally, all together now:
```{r police_3}

```
